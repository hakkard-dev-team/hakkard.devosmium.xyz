# Overview of Changes
Second changelog! We've added the catacomb framework, and the first quest. The rebase is going well, and we're working faster than ever. We've additionally decided to make our core repository public to invite user-contributed changes.

We've also forked the Ranvier websocket client, which has the advantage over other clients in that it can be designed to read data from the game and display it in a HUD.

# List of Changes
- Added Lord Everett to the manor
- Added initial quest to Lennar
- Added new exits and rooms to make moving around easier
- Added websocket client
