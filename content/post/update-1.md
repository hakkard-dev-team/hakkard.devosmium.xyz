Hi guys, I'm here to provide an update on the status of the Hakkard MU* project.

## Repo Move

As of a few days ago, we're back on GitHub at https://github.com/hakkard-dev-team. This move comes as GitHub starts to come back into favor after its acquisition by Microsoft last year. GitHub allows for more people to contribute, and with the release of the majority of our codebase under the GPL, we allow for more people to build off of our work.

I personally have begun working on a new version based in Java, where the majority of the work is done for us, so that all we have to do is work on building and moderation. The majority of the world will stay the same, but the connection URL may or may not change, so stay posted in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TMdtEs2).

## Staffing Changes
Unfortunately, due to a lack of work, the Hakkard Leadership Team has been trimmed down to just me. I'll be looking to set up a different governing body that more accurately reflects the staff team (once we get more staff, that is).

## In Conclusion
I've got a lot of great stuff planned, so stay tuned.

Long Live Text-Based MUDding!
