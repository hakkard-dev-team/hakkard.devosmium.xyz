## Hakkard-Ranvier Sunset
Hey there,
As of this week, connections to the [Ranvier](https://ranviermud.com) version of Hakkard will no longer be accepted. This decision was made as we move to [CoffeeMud](http://coffeemud.org/), which will allow for more flexibility (I know Java better than I know Node). There's already more content on the HakkarDev server than there ever was on either Evennia or Ranvier. Our plans for what needs to be accomplished can be found below, in descending order of priority. The new repository is [hakkard-dev-team/hakkard-coffeemud](https://github.com/hakkard-dev-team/hakkard-coffeemud).
