# New Purpose
This site began life as a documentation source for the MUD that I was building, based on my original campaign world. Now that my original world has grown to have more than a few loosely connected stories, I want to change the focus of this subdomain. From now on, the site will contain not only updates, changelogs, and docs for the MUD, it will also contain information needed to DM a Dungeons and Dragons or other such game set in Hakkard.
