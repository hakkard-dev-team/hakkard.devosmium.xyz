### Summary

Of middling height, this man is still an imposing presence. He looks middle aged, with short blond hair thinning at the top.Though projecting confidence, his tenure as Lord of Lennar has been marred by corruption, weakening his influence in the  Confederacy. He wishes that something could be done, but he doesnâ€™t dare move against the criminals who hold near total sway over his forces.
