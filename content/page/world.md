## About
Hakkard is a passion project for me, I've always wanted to create a world for Dungeons and Dragons, that drew on Forgotten Realms and other sources from my life. Hakkard reflects a lot of the games I've played over a few years. This site is the repository for everything you need to know about the world, from locations as small as a tiny hamlet in the Northern Wastes to the overarching multiverse containing Hakkard and all the other planes.
