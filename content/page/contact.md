# Discord

This is the primary way to get in touch with the maintainers of the MUD and the world itself.. There's usually someone on who can help you, and if not, your message stays there so other people can come on later and still help you out.

Find out discord [here](https://discord.gg/TMdtEs2).

# IRC

IRC is another way to get in touch, though not many maintainers use it. We run two channels on the SynIRC network, which are #hakkard and #hakkard-mud. #hakkard is for the world in general, and can be used for worldbuilding questions and discussions. #hakkard-mud is specific to the MUD, and questions unrelated will be directed to #hakkard or the Discord server.

Connect to the network without downloading anything [here](http://webchat.synirc.net/irc.cgi?adv=1&chan=%23hakkard,%23hakkard-mud)
